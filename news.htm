		  <br>1<strong>. Police Station redevelopment</strong>. The EFA
		  (Education Funding Agency) have advised the Council that they intend
		  to pursue a 210 place school on the Police Station Site. Further
		  details are given in the AGM minutes but in summary:-  <br>
		  <br>The School wrote to the DHRA that minister level
		  support for a 210 place school had been obtained and a new proposal
		  would be submitted for a 210-pupil school. In the DHRA committee&#8217;s
		  opinion, all the issues which have led neighbours to oppose the first
		  application for a 420 pupil school remained in the case of a 210
		  school, only somewhat diluted (playground noise, traffic, disruption,
		  pollution, damage to a listed building and lack of need). <br> <br>The
		  committee also believed that it would be impossible over time to hold
		  the School to remain at 210 pupils. Given that DHRA had been assured
		  that the Education Funding Agency were adamant originally that the
		  school needed to have 420 pupils to be economic, it was mysterious
		  that 210 was now deemed viable. The DHRA committee unanimously opposed
		  the proposal. <br> <br>Funds had been generously contributed to the first
		  appeal. If a second campaign were necessary, contributions would be
		  requested again. There would also be a new political dimension to the
		  campaign, in view of public criticism of the allegedly costly and
		  unsatisfactory Free Schools initiative.  <br><br>A vote by show of hands
		  was taken at the AGM: <br> <br>A. Would the meeting support a proposal for
		  a 210-pupil school which did not grow beyond that? <strong>Defeated</strong>  <br>B. Would
		  the meeting support a proposal for 210 on the understanding that in
		  time, it would increase to 420 pupils. <strong>Defeated</strong>. <br><br>2.
		  <strong>Neighbourhood Plan</strong>  <br>Again this was discussed at the AGM but in summary
		  the Forum and Hampstead Plan had been four years in gestation. A draft
		  Plan was now about to be submitted. Residents were urged to become
		  members by signing up, which is free, at www.hampsteadforum.org/join.
		  The draft Local Plan can be seen at Keats Library and at the
		  Freemasons Arms. It is important as numerous issues relate to DH.
		  Votes from members would be vital. Importantly, plans to alter traffic
		  arrangements in South End Green would see a major increase in traffic,
		  as north-bound traffic would be sent up DH. This is an important issue
		  and all residents are encouraged to be involved. <br> <br>3. <strong>Rubbish</strong>
		  remains a problem at the top end of the street. Cllr Stark has said
		  that this had been improved with an agreement with the commercial
		  properties but no improvement had been observed yet. <br><br>4.
		  <strong>ERUV</strong>.A
		  planning application for an ERUV round Hampstead village is still
		  currently being considered. (The application relates to around 82
		  poles, almost all 5.5 metres in height, linked by nylon wire, in
		  locations from Platts Lane down to Chalk Farm and Swiss Cottage. Of
		  these 82 poles some 40 were around Hampstead. These are identified as
		  being on sites in the following streets: <br> <br>West Heath Rd; Branch
		  Hill; Redington Rd; Templewood Avenue; Judges Walk; Lower Terrace;
		  Heath Street; Cannon Place; Holford Rd; Well Walk; Christchurch Hill;
		  Willow Rd; Willoughby Rd; Pilgrims Lane; Keats Grove; Downshire Hill;
		  South Hill Park; Parliament Hill; Nassington Rd&#8221;). <br> <br>They are
		  designed to form a linked chain around the area, to permit Orthodox
		  members of the Jewish faith to carry on with aspects of their lives at
		  certain times. <br>For Downshire Hill it would mean 5 �- metre poles
		  with twine at the lower end of DH. Camden Council have informed us
		  that it was still considering the application for each pair of
		  perimeter poles on a location basis, and was apparently minded to
		  grant approval if it could clarify these issues for all pole
		  locations. It would finally be decided at a public planning committee
		  meeting. At the AGM the chairman asked for a show of hands as to
		  agreement or not with non-residents not allowed to vote.  <br><br>By a
		  count of 15 to 7 the AGM did not agree to the ERUV proposal and S D
		  Ainger said he would reflect these views to the Council. <br><br>5.
		  <strong>The Garden party</strong> this year will be held in September. Further details
		  to follow. <br><br><br>S D Ainger <br>v 20170607 <br>&nbsp;</p>

		  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As

		  school. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The
		  Free School, funded by the Education Funding Agency (EFA) has not
		  appealed but they have very recently decided to submit a new planning
		  application for a single form entry school with 210 pupils. This is
		  clearly a big change as in their original planning application the EFA
		  was very clear in stating that a smaller 210 place school was not
		  financially viable. All of the issues originally raised will, of
		  course, have to be addressed again and we will need to see a scheme
		  before we can comment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
		  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Many
		  believe that an application for 210 pupils would just be the first
		  phase and we should expect a phase two, to take it up to 420 pupils,
		  at a later date. It is also surprising that they have been unable to
		  find premises for a scaled-down school in the Belsize Park catchment
		  area which would have resolved many of the issues related to the
		  proposed use of the old police station.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		  The saga with the planning application for a 420 place School at the
		  site of the Old Police Station continues. <br><br>Following the
		  rejection of the planning application by the Council we have again
		  written to the Education Funding Agency, the agency that is funding
		  the new school, and they have replied saying that they are considering
		  their options. As far as we are aware the Council have not heard
		  anything new. <br><br><strong>ERUV Planning application 2016/1436/P
		  </strong><br><br>The Council is still considering the application on a
		  site by site basis trying to mitigate harm. <br><br><strong>Basements.</strong>
		  The DHRA were asked to attend a hearing about the Council&#8217;s new policy
		  regarding basements. The main points made were:- <br><br>1) In the
		  s106 agreement between the Council and the developer it is important
		  that party wall agreements should be included as part of any Detailed
		  Construction Plan approved by the council under s106. Not to do so
		  would effectively undermine a neighbours&#8217; ability to comment on the
		  construction methodology as, once it had been approved by the Council,
		  it was difficult and potentially very expensive to challenge. <br><br>
		  2) The level of damage to neighbours&#8217; property should be restricted to
		  Burland scale 1 outside of the zone of the party wall itself. <br>The
		  inspector listened to the proposals and we hope she will include them
		  in the final draft. <br><br><strong>Garden Party</strong> <br><br>The
		  Garden Party went well in September and many thanks to Margaret and
		  Christabel for organising it. <br><br><strong>Rubbish</strong> <br>
		  <br>Rubbish at the top end of the street continues to be a problem. Of
		  course residents are allowed to put rubbish out on certain days for
		  collection in strict time windows but I am afraid, with school
		  holidays etc, the rubbish is sometimes put out days early and hence
		  gets distributed across the street by the foxes. We are trying to sort
		  out a permanent solution and Camden is collecting more frequently from
		  the top 50 meters of Downshire Hill but it can still be bad. Camden is
		  also searching through any fly tipping to see if they can the identify
		  source. <br><br><br>As usual any questions please drop a note to
		  number 8 </p>

		  Following extensive work by DHRA and others on planning, transport,

		  the Planning meeting of Camden Council on Thursday 28 July, and after
		  about an hour and a half of debate, a unanimous vote was taken by
		  Councillors to refuse permission to Abacus to develop the old police
		  station as a 420-pupil primary school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
		  </span>This decision supported the Council officers&#8217; recommendation to
		  deny permission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		  <p class="auto-style26">The debate was wide-ranging and covered
		  heritage concerns, the bulky nature of the proposed rear development
		  in a Conservation Area, suitability of the site for its proposed
		  purpose, local amenity, the current and projected need for primary
		  school places in the area, traffic implications, noise levels and air
		  quality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was felt that
		  Abacus had increased the proposed pupil numbers from 210 to 420 with
		  little regard for the site&#8217;s suitability or indeed for the need for
		  these school places.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  Parents at the current school want the choice of a secular education
		  but it was pointed out that there are currently over 30 vacancies in
		  nearby secular Camden primary schools alone, already threatening
		  existing schools in the area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Children from even further afield would have to make up the
		  numbers with all manner of implications from traffic to the future of
		  existing, well-regarded schools.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="auto-style26">Andrew Neil gave a speech against the proposal
		  on behalf of DHRA, the Heath and Hampstead Society and other NW3
		  groups.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are indebted to
		  him for his exceptional and rigorous work over the last few months on
		  our behalf alongside other members of the Association.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="auto-style26">A huge thank you again to every one of you who
		  gave so generously to achieve this excellent result.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>We hope that it does not go to Appeal but, if it does, we are
		  well prepared to take the fight to the next stage.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="auto-style26">I am afraid however that, depending on what
		  form appeal might be lodged and how we decide to fight it, (i.e.do we
		  want to be fully represented by being a rule 6 party), we may need
		  additional funding but that is for another day. <o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="auto-style26">Abacus we believe have three months (from the
		  date of issue of the Council Minutes) to lodge their appeal and we
		  sincerely hope that they choose to withdraw from such a gross
		  overdevelopment. We shall see.<o:p></o:p></p>

		  The DHRA usually do not get involved in planning issues unless they
		  affect the character of the street or set a precedent that would
		  impact many others on the street. The super-deep basement at number 9
		  with its 40ft deep basement just an inch away from listed Georgian
		  homes was considered to be such a case. The DHRA position was that we
		  would not object to as single basement but 40ft over most of the site
		  was too much. After much lobbying Camden Council rejected the planning
		  application in 2007, even though it was recommended for approval by
		  the officers. It was refused on the grounds of likely unacceptable
		  damage to neighbours&#8217; property. Unfortunately the developer opted for
		  a Public Appeal, the most expensive form of appeal, and so Camden, the
		  Heath and Hampstead Society as well as direct neighbours and DHRA
		  funded suitable legal representation to represent residents&#8217; views. We
		  lost on the basis that, although all parties recognised that
		  significant damage would be done to neighbouring homes, it was
		  repairable and the public interest of a new home outweighed the damage
		  done.
